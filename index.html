        <p>M.S. Dhoni, in full Mahendra Singh Dhoni, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India), Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011.Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience, Dhoni took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri Lanka in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain in 2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the most for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired from international competitionDuring the 1998-99 season, he failed to make it to the East Zone U-19 squad or Rest of India squad, but he was selected for the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the next season. Unfortunately, he could not perform well and his team finished last in the tournament.He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar cricket team during the 1999-2000 season with a score of 68 not out in the second innings. He scored his maiden first-class century during a game against Bengal in the following season, but his team lost the game.Coming from a middles class Indian family, money was not a luxury for him. In fact, at the age of 20, he moved to Midnapore, West Bengal, after securing a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) job at Kharagpur railway station via sports quota. He served as a railway employee from 2001 to 2003.In 2001, he was selected to play the Duleep Trophy for the East Zone; however, Bihar Cricket Association could not communicate this information to Dhoni in time, as he was located in Midnapore. He learnt this at a time when his team had already reached Agartala, the venue for the match. While one of his friends managed to hire a car for him to reach Kolkata Airport for a flight, the car broke down halfway, resulting in Deep Dasgupta serving as the wicketkeeper.During the 2002-03 season, he continued to perform well in the Ranji Trophy and the Deodhar Trophy, which helped him get recognition. As part of the East Zone team, he won the Deodhar Trophy in 2003-2004 season, in which he scored another century.He was eventually picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya during 2003-04. He took 7 catches and had stumpings during a match against Zimbabwe XI. He also helped his team defeat Pakistan A in back-to-back matches, scoring a half century in the first, followed by two centuries. With such performance, he got noticed by the then Indian National Team captain Sourav GangulyDhoni, who did not get enough opportunities to bat in the first two matches of the India-Sri Lanka bilateral series, was promoted in the batting order for the third match of the series. He utilized the opportunity fully by scoring a speedy 183 not out off 145 balls while chasing a target of 299. He broke a number of records during the series and was named Man of the Series for his performance.During theIndia-Pakistan ODI series of 2005-06, he contributed 68, 72 not out, 2 not out and 77 not out in four of the five matches to help his team win the series 4-1. With his consistent performance, he dethroned Ricky Ponting to reach the top of the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006, even though just for a week.In the two series against West Indies and Sri Lanka before the 2007 Cricket World Cup Tournament, Dhoni showed terrific performance with an average of over 100. However, he failed to perform during the World Cup and the Indian team could not go beyond the group stage in the tournament.He was named the vice-captain of the ODI team for two series against South Africa and England in 2007. He also led the Indian team to the ICC World Twenty20 trophy in South Africa and won the trophy, defeating the Pakistani team.Following his successful captaincy in Twenty20, he was given the responsibility to lead the Indian ODI team for the series against Australia in September 2007. He would later go on to lead India to World Cup win in 2011, for which he received enormous praise from cricket legend and his then teammate Sachin Tendulkar.During 2009, he scored 1198 runs in just 24 innings to equal Ricky Ponting's score in 30 innings in that calendar year. He also stayed at the top of the ICC ODI Batsman rankings for several months in 2009.He led India to victory in the 2011 World Cup. In the final match against Sri Lanka, he promoted himself up the batting order and played a match winning knock of 91 not out.In 2013, he captained India to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy and became the only captain to have won all the ICC trophies, i.e Test Mace, ODI World Cup and Champions Trophy.It was revealed in his biopic that M. S. Dhoni had been in a relationship with a girl named Priyanka Jha during 2002. It was an intense, but short lived affair as she succumbed to injuries from a car accident the same year. Dhoni, who had been travelling with the India A team at that time, learned about the incident much later and was emotionally devastated. It took him almost a year to get back on track for his professional career.Dhoni started dating Sakshi Singh Rawat in 2008 after they met at Taj Bengal, where she worked as an intern after completing her graduation in Hotel Management from the Institute of Hotel Management, Aurangabad. Incidentally, the two knew each other during their childhood years as their fathers were colleagues at MECON and they both attended the same school, even though she was seven years younger to him.The two dated for two years and got married on July 4, 2010, one day after they got engaged. The couple gave birth to a baby girl named Ziva on February 6, 2015.After he won the Cricket World Cup in 2011, film director Neeraj Pandey decided to make a biopic on his life and achievements.
